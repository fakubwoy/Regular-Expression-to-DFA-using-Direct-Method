# Regular Expression to DFA Using Direct Method

This project is a C++ program that parses regular expressions and constructs a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) using the direct method. The program computes various properties of the regular expressions, including `firstpos`, `lastpos`, and `followpos` sets.

## Features

- **Infix to Postfix Conversion**: Converts regular expressions from infix to postfix notation.
- **Syntax Tree Construction**: Constructs a syntax tree from the postfix expression.
- **Firstpos and Lastpos Calculation**: Computes `firstpos` and `lastpos` sets for nodes in the syntax tree.
- **Followpos Calculation**: Computes `followpos` sets for the nodes based on the syntax tree.
- **DFA Construction**: Converts the regular expression into a DFA.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
